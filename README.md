# Amenity Access Analysis in London (2021 Census + OSM)

**Author**: Lina Abrahams  
**Course**: 5SSG2060 – Principles of Spatial Data Science  
**Supervisor**: Dr James Millington

This repository contains all spatial analysis and figure generation code used in the report:

> **“To what extent is walkable access to key daily amenities (schools, cafés, parks, and groceries) equitably distributed across London, and how do spatial scale and clustering influence our understanding of access inequality and planning justice?”**

---

## 📍 Overview

This project investigates spatial inequality in access to daily amenities across London. The analysis combines:

- UK **2021 Census** data  
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** amenity data  
- **London Borough** and **LSOA boundaries**

The workflow applies spatial data science techniques from the module, including:

- Spatial joins & composite scoring  
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)  
- Global & Local Moran’s I (LISA)  
- Choropleth mapping  
- Cluster and outlier analysis

## 🧠 Research Question

> To what extent is walkable access to key amenities equitably distributed across London, and how do spatial scale and spatial autocorrelation affect interpretations of planning justice?
